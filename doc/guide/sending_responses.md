# Sending Responses

Many of the functions in the callback module allow to send a response to the incoming request. NkSIP allows you to use easy response codes like `busy`_, `redirect`_, etc. Specific responses like `authenticate`_ are used to send an authentication request to the other party. In case you need to, you can also reply any response code, headers, and body. 

The full list of available responses is describe in the [reference page](../reference/responses.md).
